%% Corraltion-Matrix for modified Pearson-Filon statisti (ZPF)
    % include crossed correlations for a correlation-matrix
   
    
%% Random effect analysis
% in this analysis first the contrast is made and afterwards the
% second-level analysis. One common way to compare 2 R-pearson correlations
% is Fisher-Ztest, which can yield the statistic and CI as well, and the
% SD. With this I could d second level analysis. However it is for
% non-reoeated measures...
% solution Comparing Correlated but Nonoverlapping Correlation Coefficients
% allows comparing 2 vaariables in 2 different time points
%
% modified Pearson-Filon statistic, the ZPF statistic is superior to the PF statistic:

% Raghunathan, T. E., Rosenthal, R., and Rubin, D. (1996). Comparing correlated but nonoverlapping correlations. Psychol. Methods 1, 178â€“183
% which is a recommended test statistic for two, non-overlapping dependent correlations (Krishnamoorthy and Xia, 2007).

%some modifications
% this tests allow to measure the correlation of 2 variables in 2 time
% points to see if it changes, this is an example of non-overlapping
% correlation

% Once the levels  were  adjusted, the  power  of ZPF   was  only slightly better  than that  of  PF.   Nev- ertheless,   the   main advantage  of   using  ZPF   is  that the levels   do  not   need  adjustment  
% Pair An identification number for the pair of correlations being compared
% N    The number of subjects.
% A RT time 1
% B value time 1
% X RT time 2
% Y value time 2
% AB   Correlation between variables A and B at time 1.
% AX   Correlation between variable A at time 1 and A at time 2.
% AY   Correlation between variable A at time 1 and B at time 2.
% BX   Correlation between variable B at time 1 and A at time 2.
% BY   Correlation between variable B at time 1 and B at time 2.
% XY   Correlation between variables A and B at time 2.

%  We want to compare AB with XY.     
    
% for independent correlations, between subjects for example, Fisher
% transform of r to Z, and then Z test. But here are dependent, within!
