function good_based_analysis
 
%according to good-based models, the decision can be made based solely on 
% good information, without effort and combining both in motor/parietal
% regions as most people defend. Here  could check if there are cells in
% amygdala directly correlated to the final value of the product. In my
% paradigm, effort is negligible, so action value = good value, but can
% this decision be already be tracked in the amygdala? check
% Padoa-Schioppoa papers to see how he did it
%
% According to Glipcher/Rangel, the SV is independent of the decision made
% thus, in a 2AFC, the SV is the value of both or of the difference, but
% not the value of the chosen object. For example, if 2 stimuli, 1 with
% value 1 and other 2, the activity of SV should be either -1 or 1, not 2.
% If the activity is 2, and every time the patient decides one item, the
% activity correlates with this chosen one, then would mean that the value
% encoded depends on the outcome, so that the decision was already made
% when this activity started.
%This is what Padoa-Schioppoa calls offer value and chosen value.

%However, it could be that it is a precursor
% but once it the decision is made a feedback loop signals it into the
% previous region again. Isn't it?

%
%Morover, the activity in value should be independent if the image is on
%left or right! 
%
%Of couse, for this reason it should be
% also independent of effort, but as no effort... not so sure!
